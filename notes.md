Issues to create: 

Gather data: Identify and obtain the necessary data for the simulation. This could include data on ocean currents, wind patterns, topography, and historical data on marine litter distribution in the Gulf of Guinea.

Create a user interface: Develop a user interface that will allow users to interact with the simulation and control various parameters such as the start and end dates, the frequency of data updates, and the size and type of marine litter being tracked.

Test the simulation: Test the simulation to ensure that it accurately reflects the movement of marine litter in the Gulf of Guinea and that the results match the expectations.

Validate the simulation: Validate the simulation against real-world data to ensure that it accurately reflects the real-world conditions in the Gulf of Guinea.

To generate sample data for a marine litter simulation in the Gulf of Guinea, you can consider the following factors:

Type and volume of litter: The types of litter present in the Gulf of Guinea and the amount of each type can impact the simulation. You may need data on the distribution of litter items in the water, such as plastic bags, bottles, and fishing gear.

Currents and ocean conditions: The simulation should take into account the ocean currents and conditions in the Gulf of Guinea, as they play a significant role in the transport of litter. You may need data on the direction, speed, and intensity of the currents.

Coastline and topography: The shape of the coastline and the topography of the sea floor can also impact the movement of litter. You may need data on the coastline shape and bathymetry of the Gulf of Guinea.

Time: The simulation should also consider the amount of time that has passed since the litter was released into the water. You may need data on the age of the litter and how long it has been in the water.
