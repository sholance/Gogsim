Issues to create: 

Gather data: Identify and obtain the necessary data for the simulation. This could include data on ocean currents, wind patterns, topography, and historical data on marine litter distribution in the Gulf of Guinea.

Create a user interface: Develop a user interface that will allow users to interact with the simulation and control various parameters such as the start and end dates, the frequency of data updates, and the size and type of marine litter being tracked.

Test the simulation: Test the simulation to ensure that it accurately reflects the movement of marine litter in the Gulf of Guinea and that the results match the expectations.

Validate the simulation: Validate the simulation against real-world data to ensure that it accurately reflects the real-world conditions in the Gulf of Guinea.
